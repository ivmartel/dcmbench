* Core: Serialize expected and actual values only when test fails to improve testing speed for passing tests. #183

* Core: Fix a bug where after an async test, assertions could move between test cases because of internal state (config.current) being incorrectly set
* Core: Handle `expect(0)` as expected, i.e. `expect(0); ok(true, foo);` will cause a test to fail. (mmchaney) [#158](https://github.com/qunitjs/qunit/pull/158)
